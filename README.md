# DyslexicAI Hackathon - Letter-Sound Correspondence Project

This repository documents our team's efforts in the DyslexicAI Hackathon, a collaborative event organized by DyslexicAI and Olympus at AUI University. In this 40-hour hackathon, we tackled the challenge of Letter-Sound Correspondence, striving to make a meaningful impact on accessibility for individuals with dyslexia.

## Project Overview

Our goal was to develop AI-powered solutions that facilitate the conversion of text to speech and speech to text, enhancing the reading and communication experience for individuals with dyslexia. Leveraging state-of-the-art technologies and frameworks, we crafted a comprehensive solution that empowers individuals to interact more effortlessly with written and spoken language.

## Technology Stack

Our project employed a robust technology stack, combining the strengths of various tools and frameworks:

- **Backend**: We utilized Django as our backend framework, creating a strong foundation for our application.
- **Database**: SQLite served as our database system, ensuring data integrity and reliability.
- **Docker & Nginx**: To containerize and deploy our application efficiently, we employed Docker with Nginx.
- **Frontend**: Our user interface was built using React, offering a responsive and intuitive experience.
- **UI Design**: We used Tailwind CSS for designing a user-friendly and accessible interface.
- **AI Models**: Python was instrumental in developing custom AI models to bridge the gap between text and speech.

## Repository Contents

This repository contains the codebase for our DyslexicAI Hackathon project. The key components include:

- Backend code built with Django.
- Docker configuration for containerization.
- React-based frontend for user interaction.
- AI models developed in Python for text-to-speech and speech-to-text conversion.
